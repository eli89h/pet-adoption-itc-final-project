        <h5>WHO WE ARE</h5> The Shelter Pet Project is the result of a
        collaborative effort between two leading animal welfare groups, the
        Humane Society of Israel, and the leading producer of public service
        advertising (PSA) campaigns. Our goal is to make shelters the first
        place potential adopters turn when looking to get a new pet, ensuring
        that all healthy and treatable pets find loving homes. We do this by
        breaking down misconceptions surrounding shelter pets and celebrating
        the unique bond between every shelter pet and parent.
